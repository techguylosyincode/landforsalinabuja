<p class="lead text-xl text-gray-600 mb-8"><strong>"Does this land have C of O?"</strong></p>

<p>This is the most common question I hear from first-time land buyers in Abuja. And it is a good question. But often,
    the answer is: <strong>"No, it has an R of O."</strong></p>

<p>At this point, many buyers panic. They think "R of O" means "Fake" or "Inferior." They walk away from a perfectly
    good deal in <a href="/buy/idu">Idu</a> or <a href="/buy/lugbe">Lugbe</a> because they don't understand the
    difference.</p>

<p>Here is the truth: <strong>Some of the best investment opportunities in Abuja right now only have an R of O.</strong>
    If you wait for a C of O, you might be paying 50% more for the exact same plot.</p>

<p>In this guide, I will break down the technical and practical differences between a <strong>Certificate of Occupancy
        (C of O)</strong> and a <strong>Right of Occupancy (R of O)</strong>, so you can stop guessing and start
    investing with confidence.</p>

<h2>What is a Right of Occupancy (R of O)?</h2>
<p>A <strong>Right of Occupancy</strong> is simply an offer. It is the government telling you: <em>"We have allocated
        this plot of land to you, subject to you paying the fees and developing it."</em></p>
<p>When the Minister of the FCT approves a land allocation, the first document issued is the R of O. It contains:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Plot Number and Cadastral Zone.</li>
    <li>The size of the land.</li>
    <li>The purpose (Residential, Commercial, etc.).</li>
    <li>The terms of the lease (usually 99 years).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is an R of O a valid title?</strong> Yes. It is a legal title. However, it is a <em>transitional</em> title.
    It is meant to be "perfected" into a C of O.</p>

<h2>What is a Certificate of Occupancy (C of O)?</h2>
<p>A <strong>Certificate of Occupancy</strong> is the superior title. It is the final proof of ownership issued by the
    government <em>after</em> you have accepted the R of O, paid all the statutory fees (like the premium, ground rent,
    and survey fees), and registered the land.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: <strong>R of O is the admission letter; C of O is the degree certificate.</strong></p>

<h2>Should You Buy Land with Only an R of O?</h2>
<p><strong>Yes, absolutely.</strong> In fact, for investors looking for high ROI, R of O lands are often the sweet spot.
</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> Because they are cheaper. You can buy a plot in <a href="/buy/katampe-extension">Katampe
        Extension</a> with an R of O for ₦80 million, perfect the title yourself (pay the government fees), and
    instantly increase the value to ₦120 million because it now has a C of O.</p>
<p><strong>The Catch:</strong> You must verify that the R of O is genuine. Because R of Os are just paper documents
    (unlike the digitized C of O), they are easier to forge. You <strong>MUST</strong> conduct a "Legal Search" at AGIS
    to confirm the file exists and is in the seller's name. (Read our guide on <a
        href="/blog/how-to-verify-land-title-in-abuja">How to Verify Land Titles</a>).</p>

<h2>How to Upgrade an R of O to a C of O</h2>
<p>If you buy land with an R of O, you should aim to upgrade it. Here is the process:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Recertification:</strong> Ensure the R of O has been recertified (updated to the new digital system).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Payment of Bills:</strong> Pay all outstanding Ground Rents and the C of O processing fee.</li>
    <li><strong>Survey:</strong> Submit a registered survey plan of the land.</li>
    <li><strong>Issuance:</strong> The FCT Minister signs the C of O, and it is delivered to you.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion: Don't Let Terminology Scare You</h2>
<p>The difference between C of O and R of O is largely about <strong>maturity</strong> and <strong>price</strong>. A C
    of O is a mature, expensive title. An R of O is a developing, affordable title.</p>
<p>If you are building your dream home and want zero stress, buy a C of O. If you are an investor looking to maximize
    profit, look for verified R of O titles in developing districts.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

<h3>1. Can a C of O be revoked?</h3>
<p>Yes, but only for "overriding public interest" (e.g., the government needs to build a road). In such cases, the
    government is legally required to pay you compensation. An R of O can be revoked more easily if you fail to develop
    the land within the stipulated time (usually 2 years).</p>

<h3>2. How much does it cost to convert R of O to C of O?</h3>
<p>It depends on the size and location of the land. For a standard 1,000sqm residential plot, the official fees can
    range from ₦500,000 to ₦2 million, excluding your surveyor and legal fees.</p>

<h3>3. Is a "Deed of Assignment" the same as a C of O?</h3>
<p>No. A Deed of Assignment is just the contract between you and the seller. It proves you bought it. The C of O proves
    the government recognizes you as the owner. You need the Deed to get the C of O.</p>
