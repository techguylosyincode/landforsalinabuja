        Abuja's real estate market is booming, but where there is money, there are scammers.
        Every year, unsuspecting buyers lose billions of Naira to fake agents, forged titles, and "allocation" scams.
        Here is your survival guide to spotting and avoiding land scams in Abuja.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">1. The "Allocation Paper" Scam</h2>
    <p>
        This is the most common scam in Abuja. A seller presents an "Allocation Letter" from AMAC or FCDA.
        <strong>The Trap:</strong> Many of these papers are either forged or have been revoked.
        Paper allocations without a corresponding C of O or R of O processing file at AGIS are risky.

        <p class="font-bold text-red-700">Red Flag:</p>
        <p>If the seller rushes you or says "the allocation is expiring soon, pay now," run.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. The "Flash Sale" Price Trap</h2>
    <p>
        "Land in Maitama for ₦20 Million!" — If it sounds too good to be true, it is.
        Scammers use ridiculously low prices to bait greedy buyers.
        Prime land in Abuja has a market value; anything significantly below that is likely a scam or a litigation case.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. Fake "Estate" Developers</h2>
    <p>
        You see a billboard for "Paradise City Estate" in a bush. You pay for a plot.
        Two years later, there is still no road, no fence, and the "developer" has vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>The Fix:</strong> Only buy from developers with a track record of delivered projects.
        Visit their <em>completed</em> estates, not just the proposed ones.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">4. Impersonating the Owner</h2>
    <p>
        The person showing you the land claims to be the owner. They even have keys to the gate.
        But after you pay, the real owner shows up from abroad.
        Scammers often pose as owners of vacant, unfenced lands.

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Conduct a Legal Search:</strong> Never pay without verifying the file at AGIS (Abuja Geographic
            Information Systems).</li>
        <li><strong>Meet the Owner:</strong> Insist on meeting the owner physically or via a verified video call. Do not
            deal only with agents.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Lawyer:</strong> Don't save money on legal fees. A lawyer will spot loopholes you will miss.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Verify the Surveyor:</strong> Ensure the coordinates on the plan match the actual land location.
        </li>
    </ul>
