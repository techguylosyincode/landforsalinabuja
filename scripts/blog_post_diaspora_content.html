        For Nigerians living in the UK, US, and Canada, the question is no longer "should I invest home?" but "where is
        safe to invest?"
        Abuja has emerged as the #1 destination for Diaspora capital. Here is why.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">1. Security and Stability</h2>
    <p>
        Compared to other major cities, Abuja offers a level of sanity and security that appeals to those used to
        Western standards.
        The presence of the Federal Government and diplomatic missions ensures better policing and lower crime rates.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. The "Dollar Power" Advantage</h2>
    <p>
        With the current exchange rate, your Dollars or Pounds go much further.
        A property that costs $100,000 is now a multi-million Naira asset that commands respect and high rental income.
        It's a massive discount on luxury assets.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. High Rental Yields in Dollars</h2>
    <p>
        Many landlords in high-end districts like Maitama and Guzape now charge rent in Dollars or at dollar-pegged
        rates to expatriates.
        This creates a hedge against inflation and a steady stream of foreign currency income.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">4. Organized Urban Planning</h2>
    <p>
        Diaspora investors hate chaos. Abuja's Master Plan means wide roads, designated commercial zones, and less risk
        of "omo onile" (land grabber) issues common in Lagos.
        You buy a plot, and it stays your plot.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">5. Retirement Plan</h2>
    <p>
        Many in the diaspora plan to return home eventually.
        Building a home in a serene, well-infrastructure district like Katampe or Idu ensures a comfortable retirement
        lifestyle that matches what they are used to abroad.
